# Data

## Rule

Keep the wire contract with the project's API in `src/api-contract/`: `createClient`, which builds every URL
including the `/api/v1` prefix, the `ApiError`, the hand-written request and response types, and the query
factories. **Let the app inject the transport** (`createClient({ baseUrl, fetch })`) with
`credentials: 'include'` on the web configured there, once. In a monorepo the same directory is
`packages/api-contract`.

Call Better Auth's routes through Better Auth's own client, `createAuthClient`, configured once. In `mobile`, give it
the `expoClient` plugin, and let the transport for the project's API attach the session with `auth.getCookie()` and
send `credentials: 'omit'`. Do not write
its routes, bodies or responses by hand, and do not send them through the wrapper.

Declare request and response types by hand, in `api-contract/`. Do not generate a client
from the OpenAPI document, and **do not `import type` an entity from the API package**; see below.

Give every query a factory in `api-contract/`, taking the client and returning the whole options object so the key and the fetch
function travel together. Include in the key everything that changes the result: filters, cursor,
ordering.

Let the client parse every `application/problem+json` body into one `ApiError` carrying `status`,
`title`, `detail`, `requestId` and the `errors` map, and throw it. Convert the auth client's `error` into the
same `ApiError` in one adapter. No component reads a raw error body.

Use `useInfiniteQuery` for paginated lists, with `getNextPageParam` returning `nextCursor`, or `undefined`
once it is null.

Invalidate explicitly in each mutation's `onSuccess`, building the key from the same factory. Never
invalidate everything.

## Rationale

Types are written by hand because generated ones arrive as deeply nested `paths[…][…][…]` shapes that
every project then wraps in aliases to make usable. The cost accepted in exchange is real and silent: the
API renames a field, the client keeps compiling against its own copy, and the failure appears as
`undefined` on a screen.

**Importing the entity type from the API package looks like the obvious fix and is unsound.** Responses
are entities passed through `ClassSerializerInterceptor`, so every `@Exclude`d property is missing from the
JSON while remaining on the entity type. The shared type would promise `tenantId` on a payload that never
carries it: a type that lies, which is worse than the duplication it removes.

**The contract lives in one directory, not beside each feature, so that one template serves both
architectures.** The monorepo form moves `api-contract/` whole into `packages/api-contract` and changes one
import prefix. Scattered across features, the same code would need gathering at copy time, or a second copy
of it. It also mirrors the API: every wire shape in one place, so a renamed field has one file to fix. **What it
costs:** a project that stays `alone` passes its transport as a parameter it never varies.

The query factory settles by construction what would otherwise be discipline. Wherever something
prefetches and something else reads (a route loader on the web, a screen preloading the next one) a
difference between their keys fills one cache entry while the other is read, paying twice and gaining
nothing, with no warning. A key that omits a filter is the same class of fault: two screens share one
entry and the second shows the first's data.

**There are two doors because there are two contracts.** The project's API is ours, so its types are written
here. Better Auth's routes are Better Auth's: hand-writing them would copy a contract we do not control, which
drifts on every upgrade and grows with every plugin. Its client already carries those types and follows the
library, and `multi-tenancy/client.md` depends on it. **Its errors are not problem+json**: `toNodeHandler`
writes the response itself, past the exception filter, so the body is `{ message, code }` with no `requestId`.
The adapter is what keeps that difference out of every form.

One `ApiError` keeps the shape of problem+json in a single file instead of in every component that
displays an error. It also puts `requestId` on every failure without anyone asking, which is what makes a
500 that reveals nothing supportable: the user opening a ticket arrives with the identifier that finds the
log line.

Invalidating everything is never wrong and makes a screen with six queries fire six requests on any save,
which reads as an application that is slow for no reason.

## Applies to

Every client (`web`, `mobile` and `site`) for every call to the API.

The TanStack Query rules apply where Query is used, which is `web` and `mobile`. A `site` fetching on the
server uses the wrapper, the hand-written types and the `ApiError`, and not the query factory or
`useInfiniteQuery`.

## Examples

The query factory:

```
✅  export const ordersQuery = (filters) => ({ queryKey: ['orders', filters], queryFn: … })
    // every caller builds the key the same way
❌  prefetch:  queryKey: ['orders']
    component: queryKey: ['orders', filters]
```

Reaching the server:

```
✅  api.get('/users/me')                         authClient.signIn.email({ email, password })
❌  api.post('/auth/sign-in/email', { … })       // Better Auth's contract, copied by hand
```

Reading an error:

```
✅  catch (e: ApiError) { form.setErrors(e.errors); toast(e.title, e.requestId) }
❌  catch (e) { const body = await e.response.json(); body['errors'] }
```

Invalidating:

```
✅  onSuccess: () => qc.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: ordersQuery().queryKey })
❌  onSuccess: () => qc.invalidateQueries()
```

## Enforcement

**Structural.** The key and the fetch function cannot disagree, because the factory returns both. The
error shape is parsed in one place, so no component can depend on the wire format.

**Review only, and two of these fail silently:**

That a hand-written type still matches what the API returns. Nothing checks it, and the divergence appears
as `undefined` at runtime. This is the known cost of not generating the client.

That a query key includes every filter that changes the result.

That a mutation touching two resources invalidates both. Forgetting one leaves that screen stale.
